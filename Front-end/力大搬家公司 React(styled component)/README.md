## What
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can watch the website with [power-moving site](https://huangjamison.github.io/power-moving/).

## Why and learn
My father is moving worker, I think that I can use my skill to help him to get more customers.

I've learned react skills for six months at my work. In this project, I learn how to use `styled component`, `function components`, `HashRouter and BrowserRouter` and using more robust structure to build a website.


## How to start this project
I recommend github flow to work with my partners. This concept also used at my work.
Here is an good article to introduce [github flow](https://medium.com/@lf2lf2111/%E4%B8%89%E7%A8%AE%E7%89%88%E6%8E%A7%E6%B5%81%E7%A8%8B-29c82f5d4469).
